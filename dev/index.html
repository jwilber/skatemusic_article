			<blockquote>
				"But the most important thing is a good song. The best skateboarding in the world can look fucking awful with a bad soundtrack."
			</blockquote>
		
			<p>Since its earliest days, skateboarding has been intrinsically linked with music. Many well-known artists have referenced skateboarding as a defining influence, and many popular songs explicitly mention the act of skateboarding.</p>
		
			<!--<p>Culturally, skateboarding is associated with a large variety of musical genres, and almost all have had a stint of popularity at some point in skateboarding.</p>-->
		
		
			<p>	To explore the music used in skateboarding, we'll look to skate videos, which showcase skateboarding from some group of individuals, usually associated with a skate company or crew of friends. In general, each skater gets their own section in the video, with his/her own song.</p>
		
		
			<p>The choice of song is very important, sometimes even more so than the skating itself. A good song sets the tempo of the video part; it matches with the skater's style and contributes to an overall aesthetic for the video. In contrast, a bad song may ruin the experience, resulting in an unremarkable, forgetable video part.</p>
		
		
			<p>Growing up, like most skaters, if I wasn't skating, I was watching skate videos, discovering not only my new favourite skaters, but my new favourite music. My first skate video turned me on to a diverse set of amazing artists, such as Dinosaur Jr., Black Flag, and John Coltrane. </p>
		
		
			<p>In a time before Spotify or Pandora, skate videos provided something of a music tastemaker - a playlist of what's cool and who's hot in music. The playlist spanned all genres and all time-frames. It felt diverse. It felt counter-culture. It felt cool. </p>
		
		
			<!--<p>In what follows, we'll explore the contents of this playlist, as well as learn how it can be used to track the evolution of the styles and trends in skateboarding over time.</p>-->
		
			<p> In what follows, we'll explore how the music of skateboarding changed over time, how genres relate to particular styles of skating, and who skateboarder's favorites are.</p>

				<h3 class='intro__dek tk-atlas' style="">Music Evolution Over Time</h3>
			  <p>Like any sufficiently developed sub-culture, skateboarding has gone through, and continues to go through, temporal shifts in styles and trends.</p>
			  <p> As the culture of skateboarding changed, so too did the music.
		
			  <!<p>Particular music genres are often associated with particular styles in skateboarding. For example, hip hop is often used with technical street skating, while heavier, faster music is generally used with transition (think ramps and ppols).</p>
			  <p>It's not surprising, then, that the year-to-year changes in the genre of skate video's often reflects the year-to-year changes in the styles of skateboarding, serving as a vessel for communicating what was hot in that genre.</p>

						<h4>Music Evolution Over Time</h4>
						  <!--<p>Like any sufficiently developed culture, the styles and trends of skateboarding have evolved over time, with different trends and styles coming in and out of popularity.</p>-->
						  <p>Over time, skateboarding has evolved: different styles and techniques of skateboarding have come and gone, skateboarding has risen and fallen from popularity, and the general aesthetics of skateboarders have changed.<p>
		
						  <p> These dramatic shifts in skateboarding culture often correlate with changes in the popular music of skate videos, allowing us to observe how the two have evolved over time.
						  <!--Thus, we can observe the shifts in music overtime as a proxy to the cultural changes in skateboarding at large.--></p>
		
						  <!--the popularity of different genres map to different times in skateboarding, often reflecting the cultural shifts taking place at the time. </p>
						  <p> Thus, observing the shifts in popular genre provide something of a map to the relevant styles of skateboarding at any given time.</p>
		
						  <p>Particular music genres are often linked with particular styles in skateboarding. For example, hip hop is often used with technical street skating, while heavier, faster music (e.g. Punk or Metal) is generally used with transition skating.</p>
						  <p>It's not surprising, then, that the year-to-year changes in the genre of skate videos reflects the year-to-year changes in the styles of skateboarding. That is, we can use the popularity of music for a given time-frame to understand which types of skateboarding were popular in that period.</p>-->
					</div>
					
					<div class='step' data-step='2' data-year="1990">
						<h4> The Beginnings </h4>
						<p>Following the advent of the VHS tape, skate videos became an established feature of skateboarding culture in the later-half of the 1980s.
						<br><br>
						For skateboarding, the 1980s were a pretty wild time. Many DIY, skater-run companies were forming. Vert skating, with its eclectic and show-man personalities, was in full popularity. And skateboarding was, for the first time, seeing commercial success.
						Early skate videos, borrowing from skateboarding's counter-culture origins, were overwhelmingly dominated by punk rock music.
						<br><br>
						 Although many of the artists featured in the first videos were temporary groups formed by the skaters themselves,  early punk icons, such as Black Flag, The Faction, and Descendents, saw prominent use.
						 <br><br>
						In fact, many artists were featured in skate videos before their eventual rise to popularity. For example, the iconic noise rock duo Sonic Youth, an artist heavily used throughout skateboarding, was first featured in a skate video in 1989, years before their mainstream success in the 1990s/2000s.
						</p>
						<!--
							The most popular genre during this time period was punk rock, though classic rock saw a healthy amount of use as well. 
		
							These genres shared at least two similarities with skateboarding during this time period: both were loud and fast, and both were counter-culture.
		
							Skateboarding in the 1980s was a wild time. Many DIY, skater-run companies were forming. Vert skating, with its eclectic and show-man personalities, was in full popularity. And skateboarding was, for the first time, seeing commercial success.
		
							The fast, loud tones of the decade's leading genres complimented the big airs of vert skating, while the counter-culture elements of the music reflected skateboardings roots.

						<h4> The 90's </h4>
		                <p> In the 1990’s, skateboarding's mainstream popularity ended. Vert skating died, technical street skating took over, and skateboarding entered the infamous era of ‘big pants, small wheels’. 
		                <br><br>
		                The large changes in skateboarding culture brought equally large changes in genre.
		
		                Punk and Classic Rock saw large declines in use, and Hip Hop, the defining genre of the decade, quickly took over.
		                <br><br>
		                The high use of Hip Hop during skateboardings least popular years cemented the genre as something of a new counter-culture anthem, with artist such as Gang Starr, Mobb Deep, and Nas seeing their first employment in skate videos. 
		
		                <br><br>
		                This was also a popular decade for Jazz/Funk/Soul artists, likely thanks to Spike Jonze's highly influential Video Days, which released in 1991 and featued the likes of John Coltrane, War, and The Jackson 5.

						<h4> The early 2000's </h4>
		
						<p>The success of shows such as Jackass and Viva La Bam ushered skateboarding back into mainstream popularity, and popular skateboarding changed. The low-impact technical street skating of the 90s gave way to a 'bigger-is-better' approach, as skaters began to jump down larger rails and stairs.
		
		
						<br><br>
		
						The music of skate videos evolved in tandem. Over the decade, Hip Hop's popularity gradually decreased, and Indie and Classic Rock steadily rose to prominence.
						The faster, more aggressive style of these genres fit well with the new 'gnarlier' style of skateboarding. Such changes were reflected in the fashion as well: pants became tighter,
						shows less puffy, and hair longer.
		
						<br><br>
						
						The most popular Classic Rock artists during this time were The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. For Indie music, MGMT  and Modest Mouse held the throne.

						<h4> The Contemporary</h4>
						<p>
						Currently, skateboarding is at peak popularity, with millions of skaters worldwide.
						As a result, this era of skateboarding sees no <i>single</i> defining aesthetic, and almost all styles/approaches have an audience.  
						<p>Appropriately Indie music, itself a broad categorization of music, is the most popular genre. Hip Hop, the second most popular genre of the decade, sees something of a resurgence, though ultimately ends the decade at its lowest point post-1990.</p>
						<p> It bears mention that some genres, notably electronic, metal, and rock, are not very popular in skateboarding. Perhaps this is because these genres lack the cultural intersection with skateboarding the other genres see; or maybe they just don't pair well with skateboarding. In any case, these genres remained all but stagnant over time.<p>
						<p>Interestingly, Joy Division,the inspiration for this plot, is the most popular artist of the current decade. 
						Sonic Youth, who saw earlier in some of skateboarding's first videos, breaks the top-five most popular artists;
						I guess some artists just pair well with skateboarding.

				<p>Different music genres are often associated with particular styles of skateboarding. For example, Hip Hop is often used with technical street skating, while heavier, faster music, such as Punk or Metal, is generally used alongside transition skating.</p> <p>
		
					Simlarily, different skate companies are often affiliated with specific styles of skateboarding. This begs the question, <i>can we determine a company's primary style of skateboarding, by observing the music is employs in skate videos?</i></p>
					<p> To investigate, I looked at the genre distributions for thirty-two of the most popular companies in skateboarding.

					It looks like genre provides a reasonable encoding for the skateboarding style of many companies.
					 Some observations are immediately apparent:
					<br>
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li class="waffle_list"> <p>The most dominant example of genre loyalty is DGK's whopping 92% use of Hip Hop. Other companies, namely SK8MAFIA and Zoo York, also employ Hip Hop as their majority choice of genre. Because of their coupled rising in the 1990s, Hip Hop and technical street skating are strongly associated with one another. Sure enough, those companies with high usage of Hip Hop, including those mentioned above, are principally known for technical street skating. <!--Thus, the association between Hip Hop and technical street skating still exists to this day, far beyond their coupled rising in the 1990s.--></p> 
					</li>
		
						<li class="waffle_list"> <p>Metal music is most often associated with transition skating. This association is clearly rooted in reality, as transition-focused companies, such as Blood Wizard, Bacon, and Creature, see the highest employment of the genre.</p> 
						</li>
		
						<li class="waffle_list"> <p>Classic Rock is often used with a so-called 'hesh' style of skateboarding, which is something of a catch-all term describing a gritty, unkempt style. This is reflected in the high use of the genre with companies like $lave, Vox, Lurkville, and Zero.</p> 
						</li>
		
						<li class="waffle_list"> <p>Indie music, something of the music-for-the-masses in skateboarding, proves true to its name, with almost every company featuring at least 10% of the genre.</p> 
						</li>
						<li class="waffle_list"> <p>As a final note of interest, all of the companies that use Jazz 20% or more of the time sponsor skaters that were featured in Spike Jonze's classic 1993 video "Video Days", one of the first videos to pair Jazz with skateboarding.</p>

			The very high popularity of Classic Rock artists such as The Beatles and Pink Floyd is suprising.
			Perhaps this is because Classic Rock has grown to become strongly associated with mainstream music, while skateboarding is generally associated with 'counter-culture' genres, such as Punk or Hip Hop. Still, the epic ballads and guitar-raced riffs of the genre definitely have their place in skateboarding.</a>.
			 </p>
			 </li>
		
			 <li><p>
			When it comes to Hip Hop, skaters favor pre-2000s artists, with the most popular including Gang Starr, Mobb Deep, and Public Enemy.
			While this preference may appear to be the result of a temporal bias (after all, earlier artist have more opportunity for air time), consider that for <i>every</i> year after 1999, the most popular Hip Hop artist is from the 90s. 
			</p>
			</li>
		
			<li>
			<p> Indie music isn't dominated by a select few artists. Rather, many artists feature similar levels of use, reflecting the popularity and wide selection of the genre. Arguably, this genre is responsible for the largest number of artists most-strongly associated with skateboarding, including as New Order, Modest Mouse, Dinosaur Jr., and Sonic Youth.
		
		
			</p>
			</li>
		
			<li>
			<p> Sol, the most-popular Electronic artist, was heavily used in 411VM, a video magazine from the early 2000s. Baron and Odd Nosdam, the second and third most popular artist for the genre, respectively, were each recruited to create soundtracks for individual skate-videos. These latter two artists are the source of the two spikes for electronic music in the time-series chart shown earlier. Electronic music is pretty rare in skateboarding, and aside from outlier cases such as those, it's hardly used. 
			</p>
			</li>
		
			<li>
			<p>
			Many of the displayed artists are themselves skateboarders. Bad Shit, Grindline The Band, and CKY are composed  entirely of skateboarders. Bad Shit's guitarist is the editor of Thrasher Magazine, the so-called 'bible' of skateboarding. The most-used artist from jazz, Tommy Guerrero, is himself a professional skateboarder-turned-musician. The same is true of Ray Barbee, another popular Jazz musician.
			</p>
			</li>
		
			<li>
			<p> Fugazi leads Punk as the most popular artist of the genre. Fugazi has been paired with some of skateboarding's most iconic skateboarders, and Ian Mackaye, Fugazi (and Minor Threat) lead singer, was an avid skateboarder before getting into music, describing the activity as <a href="">a defining experience</a>. Other popular artists in the genre, such as Bad Brains, Devo, and Black Flag, are among the genre's most popular, and their inclusion is hardly surprising.
			</p></li>
		
			<!--<p>  Clearly, those artists featured most often in skate videos span a diverse array of genres. 
			We'll observe each genre in turn, as well as those particular years where a certain artist dominated.
		
			I should mention that, because of the ambiguity of genre classiciation, I opted for broad genre categories.
			Because of the ambiguity and subjectivity of genre classiciation (it's hard [even within a single genre](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/punk/)), I opted to use broad genre categories.
			</p>
			<p> To reduce the sheer quantity of artists shown, I limited to displayed artists to those used at least four times in skate videos. Some observations for a few of the genres: </p>
			<br>-->
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h4> Data and Methodology </h4>
			<p> Skatevideo soundtracks were scraped from <a href="skatevideosite.com">skatevideosite.com</a>. To give a more accurate view into music in popular skateboarding culture, videos not associated with established skateboarders or skateboarding companies were omitted. For example, music from a Bolivian skate-video produced by a group of friends wasn't included.
			<br><br>
			Because genre is <a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/03/punk/">hard to classify</a>, after feeding the artists through Spotify's API to get genre, I binned the genres into broader categories.
			<br><br>
			For the bubble chart, I only included artists featured at least four times in skate videos. This was done so that artists could more easily fit in the screen, as well as for performance reasons.
