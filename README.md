I'm storing it just because I had this rough draft stored in a separate repo, and would rather not destroy it.


# Running Locally

To run locally, clone the repo, install dependencies with `npm`, and then run `gulp`:

```
git clone https://github.com/jwilber/skatemusic_article.git
cd skatemusic_article
npm i
gulp

A browser should open up with the article.
